This project is a **Sorting Visualizer** that demonstrates the inner workings of various sorting algorithms using a visual representation. The aim is to help people understand how different sorting algorithms compare in terms of efficiency, speed, and the steps they take to sort an array of elements.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:**  
  The visualizer supports several algorithms, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- **Colored Representation of Each Step:**  
  Different colors are used to represent the current state of elements during sorting:
  - **Blue**: Default state.
  - **Yellow**: Elements being compared.
  - **Red**: Elements identified as being in the wrong position and will be moved.
  - **Green**: Elements that are in their correct final position.

- **Time and Space Complexity:**  
  For each sorting algorithm, the time and space complexities are displayed:
  - **Time Complexity**: Worst, average, and best cases.
  - **Space Complexity**: The memory usage of each algorithm.
